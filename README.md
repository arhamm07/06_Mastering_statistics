## üìù Introduction

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that will help you:

- **Understand Descriptive Statistics**: Measures of central tendency, variability, and distribution.
- **Learn Inferential Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
- **Apply Statistical Methods**: Practical applications of statistical techniques in data science and research.

By exploring these notebooks, you'll build a strong foundation in statistics and learn how to apply these concepts to real-world data.
